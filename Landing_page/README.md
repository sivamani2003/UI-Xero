To create a basic README file for running a TypeScript project with Vite, you can follow this template:

---

# Vite TypeScript Starter

This is a starter template for a TypeScript project using Vite.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd vite-typescript-starter
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and open your default browser with the application running. The development server automatically reloads the page when you make changes to your code.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

This will generate an optimized build of your project in the `dist` directory.
